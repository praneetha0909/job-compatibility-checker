# Job Compatibility Checker

## üöÄ **Description**
This project is designed to help job seekers assess their resume compatibility with job descriptions for **free**. Many existing tools charge for resume scoring, so I decided to build a free solution that checks how well a resume matches a job description by evaluating key skills, experience, and qualifications.

## üí° **Why I Started This Project**
I started this project to understand how the **resume compatibility systems** work and to investigate why my resume has been getting rejected repeatedly. My goal was to explore what **criteria** these systems use to **score resumes** and how **keywords** impact the scoring. It was frustrating to see my resume rejected despite putting in effort, and I wanted to better understand **which keywords** were causing the issue and why some resumes perform better than others. 

By building this project, I aimed to not only learn how these systems function but also to create a tool that can provide valuable insights into resume optimization. It‚Äôs also important to provide a **free solution** that helps job seekers without paying for costly tools, while improving their chances of success by targeting the right skills and keywords.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Features**
- **Job Description Compatibility Check**: Upload a job description and compare it with your resume to calculate a match score.
- **Skills Extraction**: Automatically extract skills from both job descriptions and resumes.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Provides an immediate compatibility score and insights on how the resume could be improved.
- **AI-Powered Resume Suggestions**: Future enhancements will include actionable suggestions for improving your resume based on job descriptions, AI-based keyword identification, and missing skills analysis.

## üåü **Why This Project Matters**
In today‚Äôs competitive job market, candidates are often left wondering how their resumes measure up against the job descriptions. By providing a free tool, this project helps applicants identify areas to improve their resumes, aligning them better with the job they are applying for.

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**
